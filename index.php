    <h2> Welcome! </h2>

<p>Hey. We're gonna learn you some code. I hope you got your coding socks on. Cause I'm gonna knock them off. Watch out. <br>
    Ya know what we got? We got some HTML. You love HTML. I know you do. Come on, man, you've been doing HTML for years. You guys go way back. <br>
    We got some CSS too. Ya know, fine, CSS isn't as cool. I get it. But you gotta know it. It's important. Makes things pretty. Art and whatnot. What's your favorite artist?<br>
    Oh and PHP. Got a nice table for that one. Check it out. Boom bam. PHP. It does things. It resembles Javascript. Its name is recursive, and that's kinda freaky.<br>
    Also, sign up for our newsletter. We send you a new php element every day. I'm not sure if we actually do that.<br>
